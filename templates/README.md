readme 
work in progress!

the goal is to create a quick prototpe for the language recording app based on the figma designs. 

somethign important is that transcribing audio into text is probably a bit hard, so for now we are going to just implement it based off text the user inputs
then do that later. 

what happens in transcribing  is that the audio is show up on the page one by one, so let's replicate that to best effect. 

actualy

todos right now:
1. get closer to audio recording
    1. have upload audio recording possible   -> DONE
            later get it to do audio live 
    2. "translate" somehow -> 
    3. provide edit capability on the lines outputted

TODOS: 
1. create git
2. do all funciotnality 
3. roadmap it better
4. nice designs
5. create phone app version
        somehow get it onto the phone
